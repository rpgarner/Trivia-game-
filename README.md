# Trivia-game-
For my project I will be building a jeopardy like trivia game. It will have a home page where you are prompt to select a subject that will load the categories and have time to put the teams together. 


## Rules
- Divide into two teams. 
- take turns choosing a topic category and a question in that category ($100 - $500) 
- Each team will get 1 minute to answer each question. 
- If the questions is answered coprrectly, that team will recieve the value of the question they picked.
- If the questions answered incorrect. Their turn is over and the question will go back to the board.
- Your turn will be over once you have answered the questions (corectly of incorrectly) 
- Teams will alternate turns until all the questions are answered 
- The team with the most points wins.
